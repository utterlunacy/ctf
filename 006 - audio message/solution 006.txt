how to solve:

- use an online morse decoder to get the key
- use the key to get a clean version of the morse
- subtract the clean morse audio from the challenge audio to clean it up
- put the file into audacity and set it to spectrum with spectrum settings 
  - scale: linear
  - min freq: 400hz
  - max freq: 8000hz
  - gain: 40
  - range 10
  - scheme: grayscale
- make a screenshot of the qr code
- enhance the qr code until it can be scanned (e.g. using gimp)
- using something like cyberchef, xor with the key from the morse code
