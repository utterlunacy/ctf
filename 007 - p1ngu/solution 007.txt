how to solve:

inspect the file with whatever you like (strings, hex editor, cat, etc.) and find the oddly coherent string at the very end

use this in a tool like cyberchef with aes decryption as the key and iv, input should be raw, so should output, everything else can be left on default

remove the string from the end so decryption will work
