# ctf

i try to create a ctf once a week and upload it here. each folder will contain the challenge as a .zip, a readme with some information on the challenge (including a virustotal scan), a number of text files containing hints, and a text file containing a quick guide on how to solve the challenge as well as the flag encoded in base64 to avoid unintentional reading
