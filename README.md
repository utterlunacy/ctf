# ctf

i try to create a ctf once a week and upload it here. each folder will contain the challenge, a number of text files containing hints, and a text file containing a quick guide on how to solve the challenge as well as the flag encoded in base64 to avoid unintentional reading

if a challenge is a zip file, a virustotal scan result will be placed in the readme file of that challenge

challenge source code (if existent) will be uploaded to a different repo
